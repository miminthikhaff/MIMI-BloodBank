Blood Bank Management: MERN stack + Tailwind CSS. Secure authentication, donor registration, hospital inventory, role-based access.

The Blood Bank Management System is a full-stack web application created using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack and styled with Tailwind CSS, offering a user-friendly interface. It provides secure authentication for organizations, hospitals, and donors, granting role-based access control. Donors can register, manage profiles, and schedule blood donation appointments, while hospitals can effectively track and maintain records of available blood units by type and quantity, managing expiration dates and statuses. The system facilitates blood donation between donors and organizations/hospitals, keeping a history of transactions. User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for security.
